# Simulation-Experiment-System-for-Principles-of-Computer-Organization-Course
• Implemented the Web-based laboratory for Principles of Computer Organization using node.js, Express and MySQL • Encapsulated every electronic component as a class using GOJS and users can drag them onto a canvas • Users can run and save the experiment as JSON data stored in MySQL for later use • When input changed, we add effected components into a queue and modify their input until the queue is empty
